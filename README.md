# Kubernetes Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects that demonstrate how to use Kubernetes to deploy and manage applications. The projects range from basic to advanced, and cover a variety of topics such as deployment, scaling, networking, and security.

## Projects List

### Basic Level Project

1. Deploying a single application on a Kubernetes cluster: This project involves setting up a Kubernetes cluster and deploying a simple application, such as a web server, on it. This can help you understand the basics of deploying applications on Kubernetes, including creating pods and deployment objects, and exposing them to the outside world using services.

2. Setting up a multi-tiered application on Kubernetes: This project involves deploying a more complex application on a Kubernetes cluster, such as a multi-tiered web application with a front-end, a back-end, and a database. You can learn how to use Kubernetes objects such as StatefulSets and PersistentVolumeClaims to manage the components of a multi-tiered application, and how to use ingress controllers to expose them to the outside world.

3. Setting up continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) on Kubernetes: This project involves setting up a CI/CD pipeline on Kubernetes using tools such as Jenkins or GitLab CI. You can learn how to use Kubernetes objects such as Jobs and CronJobs to automate the building, testing, and deployment of your applications.

[//]: # (4. Setting up a highly available Kubernetes cluster: This project involves setting up a Kubernetes cluster that is resilient to failures and can continue to operate even if one or more of its nodes goes down. You can learn how to use features such as etcd quorum, cluster federation, and node auto-repair to make your cluster highly available.)

Setting up a Kubernetes cluster on a cloud provider: This project involves setting up a Kubernetes cluster on a cloud platform such as Amazon Web Services &#40;AWS&#41;, Google Cloud Platform &#40;GCP&#41;, or Microsoft Azure. You can learn how to use cloud-specific tools and services to set up and manage a Kubernetes cluster, and how to use load balancers and DNS to expose your applications to the outside world.)

# Prerequisites

Each project has its own set of prerequisites. Please refer to the README file in each project for the specific prerequisites. In general, you will need:

* A Kubernetes cluster: You will need to set up a Kubernetes cluster in order to deploy your applications. You can use a cloud provider or a tool such as Minikube for local development.

* A Docker image for your application: You will need to create a Docker image that contains your application and all of its dependencies. You can use a Dockerfile to automate this process.

# How to Use the Projects

To use the projects in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: Use the git clone command to clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory: Use the cd command to navigate to the directory of the project you want to use.

3. Follow the instructions in the README file: Each project has its own README file that contains instructions on how to use the project. Follow the instructions to deploy and manage your application on a Kubernetes cluster.
