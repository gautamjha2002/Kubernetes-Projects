# Project Idea
Deploying a single application on a Kubernetes cluster: This project involves setting up a Kubernetes cluster and deploying a simple application, such as a web server, on it. This can help you understand the basics of deploying applications on Kubernetes, including creating pods and deployment objects, and exposing them to the outside world using services.

# Deploying a Single Application on a Kubernetes Cluster

This project demonstrates how to deploy a single application on a Kubernetes cluster. The application used in this project is a simple web server, but you can use any type of application that you want.

## Prerequisites
* A Kubernetes cluster: You will need to set up a Kubernetes cluster in order to deploy your application. You can use a cloud provider or a tool such as Minikube for local development.

* A Docker image for your application: You will need to create a Docker image that contains your application and all of its dependencies. You can use a Dockerfile to automate this process.

## Deploying the Application

To deploy the application on your Kubernetes cluster, follow these steps:

1. Create a deployment object: Use the kubectl command-line tool to create a deployment object in Kubernetes that defines how to create and manage a set of replicas of your application. The deployment object will use your Docker image to create the replicas, which are called pods in Kubernetes.  

`` kubectl apply -f Kubernetes/Deployment.yml``

2. Expose your application: Use the kubectl command-line tool to create a service object in Kubernetes that exposes your application to the outside world. The service object will use a load balancer or a NodePort to make your application accessible from

``kubectl apply -f Kubernetes/service.yml``
